<h2 style="margin: 1em 0em 0.5em 0em">What is the goal of OpenCogData?</h2>
The goal of this project is to make it easier for researchers to find and use publicly available cognitive task data as part of research. There's already so much data out there that can be used to test new hypotheses or models; calculate effect sizes for power analysis; and estimate meta-analytic effects across studies.

<h2 style="margin: 1em 0em 0.5em 0em">What is the scope of OpenCogData?</h2>
The scope of this project is to catalogue all open datasets involving cognitive tasks (e.g., Stroop, delay discounting, 2-arm bandits). The inclusion criteria for datasets are:

1. The data were collected from human participants.
2. The data involve at least one cognitive task.
3. Trial- or item-level data are available (i.e., summary statistics are not sufficient).
