The present experiments support two conclusions about the capacity limit of working memory (WM). First, they provide evidence for the Binding Hypothesis, WM capacity is limited by interference between bindings but not items. Second, they show that episodic LTM contributes substantially to binding memory when the capacity of WM is stretched to the limit by larger set sizes. We tested immediate memory for sets of word-picture pairs. With increasing set size, memory for bindings declined more precipitously than memory for items, as predicted from the binding hypothesis. Yet, at higher set sizes performance was more stable than expected from a capacity limited memory, suggesting a contribution of episodic long-term memory (LTM) to circumvent the WM capacity limit. In support of that hypothesis, we show a double dissociation of contributions of WM and episodic LTM to binding memory: Performance at set sizes larger than 3 was specifically affected by proactive interference - but were immune to influences from a distractor-filled delay. In contrast, performance at set size 2 was unaffected by proactive interference but harmed by a distractor-filled delay.
