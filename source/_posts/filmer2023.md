A key strategic decision one must make in virtually every task context concerns the speed accuracy trade-off (SAT). Experimentally, this ubiquitous phenomenon, whereby response speed and task accuracy are inversely related, is typically studied by explicitly instructing participants to adjust their strategy: by either focusing on speed, or on accuracy. Computational modelling has been applied to deconvolve the latent decision processes involved in the SAT, with considerable evidence suggesting that response caution (the amount of evidence needed for a decision to be reached) is a key variable in the setting of SAT strategy. Neuroimaging has implicated the prefrontal cortex, the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), and the striatum in the setting of response caution. In addition, brain stimulation has provided causal evidence for the involvement of the left prefrontal cortex and superior medial frontal cortex (SMFC, which includes the preSMA) in adjustments of response caution following explicit instructions, although stimulation of the two regions has dissociable effects. Here, in a double-blind and preregistered study we investigated the role of these two regions using an incidental manipulation of SAT strategy - via stimulus signal variability - which has previously been shown to influence decision confidence. We again found tDCS applied to both regions modulated response caution, and there was a dissociation: stimulating prefrontal cortex increased, and stimulating SMFC decreased, response caution. These findings provide further support for key, but dissociable, roles of these brain regions in decision strategies whether they are implemented explicitly or incidentally.
