The other-race effect is the observation that faces from another ethnicity induce worst recall performance than faces from one's own ethnicity. This effect has been defined as a type of familiarity effect, with more familiar faces better recalled than less familiar faces. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a working memory maintenance mechanism called attentional refreshing mediates the other-race effect and that faces from one's own ethnicity are refreshed more efficiently than faces from other ethnicities. In two experiments, face ethnicity was orthogonally manipulated with cognitive load of a concurrent processing task in a complex-span paradigm (Exp. 1) and with the memory load in a Brown-Peterson paradigm (Exp. 2). Both cognitive and memory load effects are indices of the functioning of attentional refreshing. Testing Caucasian young adults, Caucasian and East-Asian faces were contrasted. Results from both experiments were congruent and against our initial hypothesis. The other-race effect in working memory does not appear to be supported by attentional refreshing. Furthermore, the results are congruent with the idea that faces as a whole are not maintained in working memory via attentional refreshing.
