Statistical learning is a powerful mechanism that extracts even subtle regularities from our information-dense worlds. Recent theories argue that statistical learning can occur through multiple mechanisms-both the conventionally assumed automatic process that precipitates unconscious learning, and an attention-dependent process that brings regularities into conscious awareness. While this view has gained popularity, there are few empirical dissociations of the hypothesized implicit and explicit forms of statistical learning. Here we provide strong evidence for this dissociation in two ways. First, we show in healthy adults (N = 60) that implicit and explicit traces have divergent consolidation trajectories, with implicit knowledge of structure strengthened over a 24-h period, while precise explicit representations tend to decay. Second, we demonstrate that repeated testing strengthens the retention of explicit representations but that implicit statistical learning is uninfluenced by testing. Together these dissociations provide much needed support for the reconceptualization of statistical learning as a multi-component construct.
