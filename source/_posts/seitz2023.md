This article compares three psychological mechanisms to make multi-attribute inferences under time pressure in the domains of categorization and similarity judgments. Specifically, we test if people under time pressure attend to fewer object features (attention focus), if they respond less precisely (lower choice sensitivity), or if they simplify a psychological similarity function (simplified similarity). The simpler psychological similarity considers the number of matching features but ignores the actual feature value differences. We conducted three experiments (two of them preregistered) in which we manipulated time pressure: one was a categorization task, which was designed based on optimal experimental design principles, and the other two involved a similarity judgment task. Computational cognitive modeling following an exemplar-similarity framework showed that the behavior of most participants under time pressure is in line with a lower choice sensitivity, this means less precise response selection, especially when people make similarity judgments. We find that the variability of participants' behavior increases with time pressure, to a point where participants are unlikely to make inferences anymore but instead start choosing readily available response options repeatedly. These findings are consistent with related research in other cognitive domains, such as risky choices, and add to growing evidence that time pressure and other forms of cognitive load do not necessarily alter core cognitive processes themselves but rather affect the precision of response selection.
