Working memory (WM) is a capacity- and duration-limited system that forms a temporal bridge between fleeting sensory phenomena and possible actions. But how are the contents of WM used to guide behavior? A recent high-profile study reported evidence for simultaneous access to WM content and linked motor plans during WM-guided behavior, challenging serial models where task-relevant WM content is first selected and then mapped on to a task-relevant motor response. However, the task used in that study was not optimized to distinguish the selection of spatial versus nonspatial visual information stored in memory, nor to distinguish whether or how the chronometry of selecting nonspatial visual information stored in memory might differ from the selection of linked motor plans. Here, we revisited the chronometry of spatial, feature, and motor selection during WM-guided behavior using a task optimized to disentangle these processes. Concurrent EEG and eye position recordings revealed clear evidence for temporally dissociable spatial, feature, and motor selection during this task. Thus, our data reveal the existence of multiple WM selection mechanisms that belie conceptualizations of WM-guided behavior based on purely serial or parallel visuomotor processing.
