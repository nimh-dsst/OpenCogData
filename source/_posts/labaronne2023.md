Contradictory results in the literature suggest that attentional refreshing can seemingly not operate efficiently in the absence of semantic representations, while at the same time it does not rely directly on retrieval from semantic memory. The objective of the present study was a better understanding of the bidirectional links between working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM), by assessing on the one hand the role of WM mechanisms in long-term recall and on the other hand how their functioning is modulated by the prior LTM content. Through two experiments, we investigated a new hypothesis: attentional refreshing requires stable WM representations independently of the presence or the absence of associated LTM traces. We manipulated this stability through short-term consolidation (Experiment 1) and multiple presentations of memoranda (Experiment 2) to evaluate how it would affect maintenance of words and pseudowords. While we found that lexicality, short-term consolidation and multiple presentations affected short-term and long-term recall, both experiments converged on the conclusion that none of these factors modulated the effect of the cognitive load of the concurrent processing task, suggesting that refreshing does not depend on LTM content nor WM representations' stability. Additionally, we found that delayed recall performance was not affected by the cognitive load, in contradiction with previous literature. These results provide new insight into the functioning of refreshing and the links between WM and LTM.
