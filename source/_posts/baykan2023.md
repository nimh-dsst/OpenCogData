Despite the crucial role of complex temporal sequences, such as speech and music, in our everyday lives, our ability to acquire and reproduce these patterns is prone to various contextual biases. In this study, we examined how the temporal order of auditory sequences affects temporal reproduction. Participants were asked to reproduce accelerating, decelerating or random sequences, each consisting of four intervals, by tapping their fingers. Our results showed that the reproduction and the reproduction variability were influenced by the sequential structure and interval orders. The mean reproduced interval was assimilated by the first interval of the sequence, with the lowest mean for decelerating and the highest for accelerating sequences. Additionally, the central tendency bias was affected by the volatility and the last interval of the sequence, resulting in a stronger central tendency in the random and decelerating sequences than the accelerating sequence. Using Bayesian integration between the ensemble mean of the sequence and individual durations and considering the perceptual uncertainty associated with the sequential structure and position, we were able to accurately predict the behavioral results. The findings highlight the critical role of the temporal order of a sequence in temporal pattern reproduction, with the first interval exerting greater influence on mean reproduction and the volatility and the last interval contributing to the perceptual uncertainty of individual intervals and the central tendency bias.
