A longstanding research question in cognitive psychology concerns how the underlying mechanisms of working memory impact long-term episodic memory. In this series of six experiments, we manipulated three different factors within a complex span task that interleaves memoranda and distractors to investigate the contribution of these factors to the creation of episodic traces: (1) the cognitive load of processing the distractors, (2) the number of distractors, and (3) the free time following the distractors. All three factors have been identified in the prior literature as important to maintenance in working memory and, consequently, later retrieval from episodic memory. Thus, it is important to understand their unique and joint effects to the long-term durability of memory traces. Across six experiments, delayed recall (i.e., episodic memory) of the items studied during the complex span tasks (i.e., working memory) was best accounted for by accumulated free time, whereas the effects of cognitive load and number of distractors were inconsistent or negligible. These results conflict with prior work suggesting that cognitive load and the number of distractors impact episodic memory. However, the current results replicate and extend those suggesting that time spent processing items in working memory promotes the creation of episodic memory traces.
