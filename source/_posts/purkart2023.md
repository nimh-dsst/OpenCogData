Some complex cognitive activities impacted by aging (future thinking, problem-solving, creative thinking) have been shown to rely on episodic retrieval, suggesting that cognitive interventions aiming to improve retrieval have the potential to induce transfer effects to these activities. Prior studies have shown that a brief one-session technique called Episodic Specificity Induction (ESI) can transiently improve episodic retrieval and induce transfer effects to complex tasks that rely on episodic retrieval in older adults. In the present proof-of-concept study, we assessed whether a training program consisting of repeated practice of the ESI technique can improve episodic retrieval and transfer to complex tasks. Fifteen healthy older adults completed a six-session intervention where they received repeated ESI practice. Before and after the intervention, nearest transfer effects were assessed using free recall, near transfer effects using recognition and associative recognition, and far-transfer effects using mean-ends problem-solving and divergent creative thinking. Before the intervention, typical ESI effects were observed (better performance after an ESI than after a control task), indicating that the ESI operated as expected in our sample. When examining the intervention effects, performance was increased after the intervention on free recall and recognition (nearest- and near-transfer) as well as problem-solving and divergent creative thinking (far transfer). These results indicate that an intervention relying on the ESI technique can produce both near and far transfer. These findings support the use of the ESI in the design of interventions that could improve retrieval and have a broad impact on a range of complex tasks.
