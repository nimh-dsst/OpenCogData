In patients with mood disorders, negative affective biases – systematically prioritising and interpreting information negatively – are common. A translational cognitive task testing this bias has shown that depressed patients have a reduced preference for a high reward under ambiguous decision-making conditions. The precise mechanisms underscoring this bias are, however, not yet understood. We therefore developed a set of measures to probe the underlying source of the behavioural bias by testing its relationship to a participant’s reward sensitivity, value sensitivity and reward learning rate. One-hundred-forty-eight participants completed three online behavioural tasks: the original ambiguous-cue decision-making task probing negative affective bias, a probabilistic reward learning task probing reward sensitivity and reward learning rate, and a gambling task probing value sensitivity. We modelled the learning task through a dynamic signal detection theory model and the gambling task through an expectation-maximisation prospect theory model. Reward sensitivity from the probabilistic reward task (ß = 0.131, p=0.024) and setting noise from the probabilistic reward task (ß= -0.187, p = 0.028) both predicted the affective bias score in a logistic regression. Increased negative affective bias in depression, at least on this specific task, may therefore be driven in part by a combination of reduced sensitivity to rewards and more variable responses.
