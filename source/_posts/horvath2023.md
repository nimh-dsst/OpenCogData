In an ever-changing environment, the synchronization of automatic and controlled behaviors is imperative for achieving successful adaptation. The nature of the relationship between these behaviors have remained inconclusive. The current study sought to shed light on this relationship by untangling how statistical learning and inhibitory control interact within the same task. The former process facilitates the automatic extraction of environmental patterns, while the latter plays a pivotal role in controlled behaviors. Participants completed a visual four-choice reaction time paradigm that combined a statistical learning task with the Eriksen flanker task. In this novel paradigm, a central target stimulus, surrounded by flanker stimuli, was either predictable or unpredictable, based on the underlying statistical regularities. Statistical regularities did not predict the flanker stimuli, allowing only target predictability to be learned. Our results, analyzed at various levels, unveiled a multifaceted relationship between statistical learning and inhibitory control. At the primary performance level, statistical learning and flanker congruency effects emerged independently from one another. However, examining conflict adaptation (congruency sequence effect) and individual differences (correlations) revealed both cooperative and competitive interactions between these processes. In sum, our results imply that the predictability of environmental features has the capacity to modulate the relationship between statistical learning and inhibitory control.
