Base rate neglect refers to the well-documented tendency for people to primarily rely on diagnostic information to identify event probabilities while discounting information about relative probabilities (base rates). It is often postulated that using base rate information requires some form of working memory intensive processes. However, recent studies have put this interpretation into doubt, showing that rapid judgments can also lead to base rate use. Here we examine the idea that base rate neglect can be explained by the degree of attention paid to diagnostic information, which predicts that having more time should lead to greater rates of base rate neglect. Participants were presented with base rate problems either with a limited time to respond or with no time restrictions. Results show that having more time results in a decrease in base rate use.
