# OpenCogData

A collection of publicly available cognitive task datasets maintained by the [Data Science & Sharing Team](https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst) at the National Institute of Mental Health.

This project is hosted on GitHub Pages using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/) and [Anatolo](https://github.com/Lhcfl/hexo-theme-anatolo).

## Submit a dataset

The aim of this project is to catalogue all open datasets involving cognitive tasks (e.g., Stroop, delay discounting, 2-arm bandits). The inclusion criteria for datasets are:

1. The data were collected from human participants.
2. The data involve at least one cognitive task.
3. Trial- or item-level data are available (i.e., summary statistics are not sufficient).
