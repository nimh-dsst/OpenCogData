Despite its relevance in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, it is widely under-studied and remains difficult to measure objectively in patient populations.

The ability to evaluate the resulting uncertainty is a key aspect of metacognition.

Here, we propose the new dynamical evidence and visibility model (dynWEV), an extension of the drift diffusion model of decision making, to account for choices, reaction times, and confidence at the same time.
