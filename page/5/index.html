These preferences are believed to be subject to neuromodulatory influence, particularly from dopamine and serotonin. As neuromodulators manifest circadian rhythms, this suggests decision making under risk might be affected by time of day. Here, in a large subject sample collected using a smartphone application, we found that risky options with potential losses were increasingly chosen over the course of the day. We observed this result in both a within-subjects design (N...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/OpenCogData/lewis-et-al-2023/">Lewis et al.

However, surprisingly little is known about sex differences in instrumental tasks, where physical effort is exerted to gain rewards. To this end, we tested 81 individuals (47 women) with an effort allocation task, where participants had to repeatedly press a button to collect food and money tokens. We analyzed the motivational phases of invigoration and effort maintenance with varying reward magnitude, difficulty, and reward type. Whereas women and men did not differ in invigoration, we...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i><a class="tag" href="/OpenCogData/tags/effort/" title="effort">effort </a></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/OpenCogData/robison-campbell-2023/">Robison &amp; Campbell (2023)</a></h3></div><div class="post-subtitle"><h4>Baseline pupil diameter does not correlate with fluid intelligence</h4></div><div class="post-links"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-023-02273-7">[Paper] </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://osf.io/569bt/"> [Data]</a></div><div class="post-content"><p>There has been debate regarding the correlation between baseline&#x2F;resting state measures of pupil diameter and cognitive abilities such as working memory capacity and fluid intelligence.

This question is central to behavioural and affective science, yet it remains largely unexamined. To investigate, we intermixed subjective momentary mood ratings into repetitive psychology paradigms. Here we demonstrate that task and rest periods lowered participants’ mood, an effect we call ‘Mood Drift Over Time’. This finding was replicated in 19 cohorts totalling 28,482 adult and adolescent participants. The drift was relatively large (-13.8% after 7.3 min of rest, Cohen’s d &#x3D; 0.574) and was consistent across cohorts....</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/OpenCogData/kraemer-gluth-2023/">Kraemer &amp; Gluth (2023)</a></h3></div><div class="post-subtitle"><h4>Episodic memory retrieval affects the onset and dynamics of evidence accumulation during value-based decisions</h4></div><div class="post-links"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_01968">[Paper] </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://osf.io/enwtd"> [Data]</a></div><div class="post-content"><p>In neuroeconomics, there is much interest in understanding simple value-based choices where agents choose between visually presented goods, comparable to a shopping scenario in a supermarket.
