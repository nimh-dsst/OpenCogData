Both in and outside the laboratory people often show preference for low-effort tasks and are willing to forgo financial reward to avoid more demanding alternatives. Mental effort, however, does not seem to be ubiquitously avoided: people play crosswords, board games, and read novels, all as forms of leisure. While such activities undoubtedly require effort, the type of cognitive demands they impose appear markedly different from the tasks typically used in mental-effort research (e.g.,...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i><a class="tag" href="/opendata/tags/working-memory/" title="working memory">working memory </a><a class="tag" href="/opendata/tags/effort/" title="effort">effort </a></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/bakst-mcguire-2023/">Bakst &amp; McGuire (2023)</a></h3></div><div class="post-subtitle"><h4>Experience-driven recalibration of learning from surprising events</h4></div><div class="post-links"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105343">[Paper] </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://osf.io/5pmhg"> [Data]</a></div><div class="post-content"><p>Different environments favor different patterns of adaptive learning. A surprising event that in one context would accelerate belief updating might, in another context, be downweighted as a meaningless outlier. Here, we investigated whether people would spontaneously regulate the influence of surprise on learning in response to event-by-event experiential feedback. Across two experiments, we examined whether participants performing a perceptual judgment task under spatial uncertainty (n &#x3D; 29, n &#x3D; 63) adapted their patterns of predictive gaze according to the...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/guida-et-al-2023/">Guida et al.

Specifically, the SMA has been known to play a dominant role in controlling goal-directed actions as well as those that are highly predicted (i.e., automatic). Yet, the essential contribution of SMA in goal-directed or automatic control of behavior is scarce. Our objective was to test the possible direct role of SMA in automatic and voluntary response inhibition. We separately applied two noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) inhibitory techniques over SMA: either...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/hirmas-engelmann-2023/">Hirmas &amp; Engelmann (2023)</a></h3></div><div class="post-subtitle"><h4>Impulsiveness moderates the effects of exogenous attention on the sensitivity to gains and losses in risky lotteries</h4></div><div class="post-links"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joep.2023.102600">[Paper] </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://osf.io/5h6wp"> [Data]</a></div><div class="post-content"><p>Does attention have a causal impact on risky decisions?
