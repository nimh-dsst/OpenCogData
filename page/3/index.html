Past work has proposed a number of metrics that people may use to attribute blame and credit to others, such as effort, competence, and force. Some theories consider only the produced effort or force (individuals are more responsible if they produce more effort or force), whereas others consider counterfactuals (individuals are more responsible if some alternative behavior on their or their collaborator’s part could have altered the outcome). Across four experiments (N &#x3D; 717), we found that participants’...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/fornari-et-al-2023/">Fornari et al.

We find choices were better described by a reinforcement learning model based on the current value of separately expected outcomes than by one based on the combined historical values of past outcomes.

Focused attention alleviates this limitation by prioritizing the most relevant mental content at a given time. Retro-cues tap into this ability by guiding attention to one working memory content, thereby improving memory speed and accuracy. So far, few attempts have been made to understand the retro-cue effect through well-established computational models, nor how their parameters track age-related changes and individual differences in focusing efficiency.
