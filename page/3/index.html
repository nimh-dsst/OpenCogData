But environmental contexts can change abruptly and unpredictably, resulting in uncertainty about the current context. Here we address two questions: how should context-specific prior knowledge optimally guide the interpretation of sensory stimuli in changing environments, and do human decision-making strategies resemble this optimum? We probe these questions with a task in which subjects report the orientation of...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/correa-et-al-2023/">Correa et al.

How are these decompositions created and used? Here, we propose and evaluate a normative framework for task decomposition based on the simple idea that people decompose tasks to reduce the overall cost of planning while maintaining task performance. Analyzing 11,117 distinct graph-structured planning tasks, we find that our framework justifies several existing heuristics for task decomposition and makes predictions that can be distinguished from two...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/falben-et-al-2023/">Falben et al.

Accordingly, in combination with computational modeling (i.e., Reinforcement Learning Drift Diffusion Model analysis), here we used a probabilistic selection task to explore the extent to which gender stereotypes impact instrumental learning. Several theoretically interesting effects were observed.

More appropriate analyses yield no evidence of model-free prediction errors in this region.

However, recent studies have challenged this interpretation by finding the same conflict effects when a matching heuristic cues the same response as logic, even on...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="pagination"><ul class="clearfix"><li class="pre pagbuttons"><a class="btn" role="navigation" href="/opendata/page/2/">Previous</a></li><li class="next pagbuttons"><a class="btn" role="navigation" href="/opendata/page/4/">Next</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><script src="/opendata/js/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js"></script><script src="/opendata/js/jquery.appear.js"></script><script src="/opendata/js/add-bookmark.js"></script><script>(function(window){var INSIGHT_CONFIG={TRANSLATION:{POSTS:"Posts",PAGES:"Pages",CATEGORIES:"Categories",TAGS:"Tags",UNTITLED:"(Untitled)",},CONTENT_URL:"/opendata/content.json",};window.INSIGHT_CONFIG=INSIGHT_CONFIG})(window);</script><script src="/opendata/js/insight.js" defer></script><div class="searchbox ins-search"><div class="searchbox-container ins-search-container"><div class="searchbox-input-wrapper"><input class="searchbox-input ins-search-input" type="text" placeholder="Search..."><span class="searchbox-close"><a class="fa fa-times-circle" onclick="closeWindow();"></a></span></div><div class="searchbox-result-wrapper ins-section-wrapper"><div class="ins-section-container"><p>Seraching...</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
