Links have been made between ED symptoms and control-seeking behaviors, which may cause relief from distress. However, whether direct behavioral measures of control-seeking behavior correlate with ED symptoms has not been directly tested. Additionally, existing paradigms may conflate control-seeking behavior with uncertainty-reducing behavior. METHOD: A general population sample of 183 participants completed part in an online behavioral task, in which...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opencogdata/biria-et-al-2023/">Biria et al.

An individual’s computational phenotype is defined as a set of mechanistically interpretable parameters obtained from fitting computational models to behavioral data. However, the interpretation of these parameters hinges critically on their psychometric properties, which are rarely studied. In order to identify the sources governing the temporal variability of the computational phenotype, we carried out a 12-week longitudinal study...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opencogdata/navidi-et-al-2023/">Navidi et al.
