Active inference portrays perception and action as interconnected inference processes, driven by the imperative to minimise the surprise of sensory observations. To examine this characterisation of oculomotor learning during a hand-eye coordination task, we tested whether anticipatory eye movements were updated in accordance with Bayesian principles and whether trial-by-trial learning rates tracked pupil dilation as a marker of...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/li-et-al-2022/">Li et al.

However, not all experiences are remembered equally well, and some elements of an experience are more memorable than others. Thus, the intrinsic memorability of past experiences may bias our decisions. Here, we hypothesized that individuals would tend to choose more memorable options than less memorable ones. We investigated the effect of item memorability on choice in two experiments. First, using food images, we found that the same items were consistently remembered, and others...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i><a class="tag" href="/opendata/tags/memory/" title="memory">memory </a></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/stevenson-et-al-2022/">Stevenson et al.

In this study we investigate both the extent to which the parameters of EAMs are related between four different decision-making domains and across different time points.
