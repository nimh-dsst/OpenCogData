Drugs that target opioid and dopamine receptors are notorious for inducing maladaptive habitual drug consumption; yet, how the opioidergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems contribute to the arbitration between habitual and goal-directed behaviour is poorly understood. By combining pharmacological challenges with a well-established decision-making task and a novel computational model, we show that the administration of the...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i><a class="tag" href="/opendata/tags/two-step/" title="two-step">two-step </a></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/lukics-lukacs-2022/">Lukics &amp; Lukács (2022)</a></h3></div><div class="post-subtitle"><h4>Modality, presentation, domain and training effects in statistical learning</h4></div><div class="post-links"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-24951-7">[Paper] </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://osf.io/hzg7w/?view_only=639eb1b8b8dd4325a7a5ce25c08cee9b"> [Data]</a></div><div class="post-content"><p>While several studies suggest that the nature and properties of the input have significant effects on statistical learning, they have rarely been investigated systematically.

Behavioral ecology has identified an optimal strategy for these decisions, but, across species, foragers systematically deviate from it, staying too long with an option or overharvesting relative to this optimum. Despite the ubiquity of this behavior, the mechanism underlying it remains unclear and an object of extensive investigation.
