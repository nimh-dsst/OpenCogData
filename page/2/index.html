Context-sensitive valuation has been documented within reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, in which values are learned from experience through trial and error. Range adaptation, wherein options are rescaled according to the range of values yielded by available options, has been proposed to account for this...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/sakamoto-miyoshi-2023/">Sakamoto &amp; Miyoshi (2023)</a></h3></div><div class="post-subtitle"><h4>A confidence framing effect: Flexible use of evidence in metacognitive monitoring</h4></div><div class="post-links"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/mpt3e">[Paper] </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/yosuke-sakamoto/Framing_Confidence_2023"> [Data]</a></div><div class="post-content"><p>Human behavior is flexibly regulated in accordance with specific goals of cognitive tasks. One notable instance is the goal-directed modulation of human metacognitive behavior, where logically equivalent decision-making problems can yield different patterns of introspective confidence depending on the frame in which they are presented. While this observation highlights the important heuristic nature of metacognitive monitoring, the computational mechanisms of this phenomenon remain elusive.
