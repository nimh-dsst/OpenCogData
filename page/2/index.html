The aim of this paper was to combine first- and third-person approaches to investigate whether the strategies individuals use during a working memory task are associated with specific task conditions, whether the strategies combine to form stable patterns, and whether the use of specific strategies is related to task accuracy.

Generalization research predominantly relies on descriptive statistics, assumes a single generalization mechanism, interprets generalization from mono-source data, and disregards individual differences. Unfortunately, such an approach fails to disentangle various mechanisms underlying generalization behaviour and can readily result in biased conclusions regarding generalization tendencies.

Our success relies, in part, on efficient processes of calling to mind and considering the right candidate actions for evaluation. When this process fails, however, the result is a kind of cognitive puzzle in which the value of a solution or action would be obvious as soon as it is considered, but never gets considered in the first place.
