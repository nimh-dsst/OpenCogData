However, reinforcement learning studies have largely ignored the role of attentional control processes on credit assignment (the process of assigning value to one’s actions). In the current study, we examined the extent to which working memory – a system that can filter and block the processing of irrelevant information in one’s mind – predicted credit assignment to outcome-irrelevant task features.
