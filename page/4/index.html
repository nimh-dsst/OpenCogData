Predictions can lead to prediction errors of varying degrees depending on the extent to which the information encountered in the environment conforms with prior expectations. Theoretical and computational models assume that prediction errors have beneficial effects on learning and memory. However, while there is strong evidence on the effects of prediction error on learning, relatively less evidence...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i><a class="tag" href="/OpenCogData/tags/memory/" title="memory">memory </a></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/OpenCogData/cesanek-et-al-2023/">Cesanek et al.

We recently developed a motor learning paradigm that reveals the categorical organization of motor memories of object dynamics. When participants repeatedly lift a constant-density “family” of cylindrical objects that vary in size, and then an outlier object with a greater density is interleaved into the sequence of lifts, they often fail to learn the weight of the outlier, persistently treating it as a family member despite repeated...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/OpenCogData/sax-et-al-2023/">Sax et al.

This impairment can arise from dysfunctional biases and&#x2F;or learning processes. However, the relationship between depression, biases and learning in metacognition is not known. Here we combined multi-trial behavioural experiments with computa- tional modelling to explicitly test whether depression impacts biases and&#x2F;or learning in a metacognitive task. First, using a perceptual estimation task with fixed feedback valence (N&#x3D;131), we show that depressive symptoms predict...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/OpenCogData/wohner-et-al-2023/">Wohner et al.

Starting point was a PWI study by Kurtz et al. (2018). It reported that naming a picture (e.g., of a duck) was slowed down by a distractor word phonologically related to an alternative picture name from a different taxonomic level (“birch” related to “bird”) when compared to an unrelated control, indicating that the alternative name was (phonologically) coactivated. Importantly, the effect was stable across repeated naming.
