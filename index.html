However, existing probabilistic models allow for two implausible possibilities: first, that no reward might sometimes be preferred over some reward (e.g., $0 now over $100 in 1 year), and second, that the same reward might sometimes be preferred later rather than sooner (e.g., $100 in a year over $100 now). Here we show that probabilistic models of discounting perform better when they assign these cases...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/harada-laszlo-et-al-2023/">Harada-Laszlo et al.

WM could be object-based, such that capacity is set by the number of individuated objects, or feature-based, such that capacity is determined by the total number of feature values stored. The present work examined whether object- or feature-based models would best explain how multifeature objects (i.e., color&#x2F;orientation or color&#x2F;shape) are encoded into visual WM. If maximum capacity is limited by the number of individuated objects, then above-chance performance should be...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="pagination"><ul class="clearfix"><li class="next pagbuttons"><a class="btn" role="navigation" href="/opendata/page/2/">Next</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><script src="/opendata/js/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js"></script><script src="/opendata/js/jquery.appear.js"></script><script src="/opendata/js/add-bookmark.js"></script><script>(function(window){var INSIGHT_CONFIG={TRANSLATION:{POSTS:"Posts",PAGES:"Pages",CATEGORIES:"Categories",TAGS:"Tags",UNTITLED:"(Untitled)",},CONTENT_URL:"/opendata/content.json",};window.INSIGHT_CONFIG=INSIGHT_CONFIG})(window);</script><script src="/opendata/js/insight.js" defer></script><div class="searchbox ins-search"><div class="searchbox-container ins-search-container"><div class="searchbox-input-wrapper"><input class="searchbox-input ins-search-input" type="text" placeholder="Search..."><span class="searchbox-close"><a class="fa fa-times-circle" onclick="closeWindow();"></a></span></div><div class="searchbox-result-wrapper ins-section-wrapper"><div class="ins-section-container"><p>Seraching...</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
