To examine this issue, we tested spatial SL using the standard lab experiment under concurrent demands: high- and low-cognitive load (Experiment 1) and, spatial memory load (Experiment 2) during the familiarization phase. We found that any type of high-load demands during the familiarization abolished learning....</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/zorowitz-et-al-2023c/">Zorowitz et al.

However, prior research has found suboptimal reliability for computational model-based performance measures for this task, limiting its usefulness in individual-differences research. These studies did not make use of several strategies previously shown to enhance task-measure reliability (e.g., task gamification, hierarchical Bayesian modeling for model estimation). Here we investigated if such approaches could improve...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i><a class="tag" href="/opendata/tags/pavlovian-go-no-go-task/" title="pavlovian go/no-go task">pavlovian go/no-go task </a><a class="tag" href="/opendata/tags/test-retest/" title="test-retest">test-retest </a><a class="tag" href="/opendata/tags/longitudinal/" title="longitudinal">longitudinal </a></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/yamaguchi-swainson-2023/">Yamaguchi &amp; Swainson (2023)</a></h3></div><div class="post-subtitle"><h4>What determines a task-switch cost after selectively inhibiting a response?</h4></div><div class="post-links"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/h8qk7">[Paper] </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://osf.io/c8hw7/"> [Data]</a></div><div class="post-content"><p>The task-switch cost is one of the most robust phenomena, but it can disappear after nogo trials where the actors decide not to respond to the target. According to the response-selection account, it is the occurrence of response selection that generates a task-switch cost on the following trial. The present study used a variety of selective go&#x2F;nogo procedures to investigate whether response selection on nogo trials is followed by a switch cost. The first two experiments aimed to replicate previous studies in which go&#x2F;nogo trials could be distinguished either...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/friehs-et-al-2023/">Friehs et al.

Economic theories usually explain this by assuming concave utility functions. Here, we provide evidence that risk aversion can also arise from relative underestimation of larger monetary payoffs, a perceptual bias rooted in the noisy logarithmic coding of numerical magnitudes. We confirmed this with psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging, by measuring behavioural and neural acuity of magnitude representations during a magnitude perception task and relating these...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="pagination"><ul class="clearfix"><li class="next pagbuttons"><a class="btn" role="navigation" href="/opendata/page/2/">Next</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><script src="/opendata/js/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js"></script><script src="/opendata/js/jquery.appear.js"></script><script src="/opendata/js/add-bookmark.js"></script><script>(function(window){var INSIGHT_CONFIG={TRANSLATION:{POSTS:"Posts",PAGES:"Pages",CATEGORIES:"Categories",TAGS:"Tags",UNTITLED:"(Untitled)",},CONTENT_URL:"/opendata/content.json",};window.INSIGHT_CONFIG=INSIGHT_CONFIG})(window);</script><script src="/opendata/js/insight.js" defer></script><div class="searchbox ins-search"><div class="searchbox-container ins-search-container"><div class="searchbox-input-wrapper"><input class="searchbox-input ins-search-input" type="text" placeholder="Search..."><span class="searchbox-close"><a class="fa fa-times-circle" onclick="closeWindow();"></a></span></div><div class="searchbox-result-wrapper ins-section-wrapper"><div class="ins-section-container"><p>Seraching...</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
